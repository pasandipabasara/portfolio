            <p>Hello! My name is Pasandi Pabasara, and I'm a web designer from Sri Lanka, learning through the computer science stream.</p>
            <!-- Describes experience and design approach in web development -->
            <p>I have over 3 years of experience in web design. My main focus is creating websites that look great and are easy for people to use. I make sure to keep up with the latest design trends and use my creativity to build visually attractive and user-friendly websites.</p>
            <!-- Explains the importance of user-centered design and client collaboration -->
            <p>I understand how important it is to make websites simple and enjoyable for users. I always put myself in the users' shoes to ensure they have a smooth experience. For every new project, I carefully research the audience and listen to the client’s needs. This helps me create designs that match what they’re looking for and provide a unique online presence that fits their brand.</p>
